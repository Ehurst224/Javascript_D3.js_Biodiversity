# Javascript_D3.js_Biodiversity

This project built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This interactive dahsboard allows you to pick a test subject ID number from the dropdown. It updates information about that test subject's ID, ethnicity, gender, age, location, bbtype, and wfreq.
